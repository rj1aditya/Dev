Enable core dumps
The primary reason to allow core dumps is for troubleshooting purposes. The dumped memory of the process can be used for debugging issues, usually by more experienced developers. A software vendor may ask to enable core dumps. Usually to discover why a process crashed in the first place and find the related routine that caused it.

Enabling core dumps on Linux is similar to disabling them, except that a few specific details should be configured. For example, if you only need details from a particular program, you can use soft limits. This is done by using -Swhich indicates that it is a soft limit. The -c denotes the size of a core dump.

ulimit -S -c 0

Next step is to only allow ‘my-program-to-troubleshoot’ to create a core dump.

ulimit -S -c unlimited my-program-to-troubleshoot

If you want to allow all processes to use core dumps, use the line above without the program, or set a system limit in /etc/security/limits.conf
